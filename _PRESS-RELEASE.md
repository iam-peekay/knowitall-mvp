There is an approach called "working backwards" that is widely used at Amazon. They work backwards from the customer, rather than starting with an idea for a product and trying to bolt customers onto it. While working backwards can be applied to any specific product decision, using this approach is especially important when developing new products or features.

For new initiatives a product manager typically starts by writing an internal press release announcing the finished product. The target audience for the press release is the new/updated product's customers, which can be retail customers or internal users of a tool or technology. Internal press releases are centered around the customer problem, how current solutions (internal or external) fail, and how the new product will blow away existing solutions.

If the benefits listed don't sound very interesting or exciting to customers, then perhaps they're not (and shouldn't be built). Instead, the product manager should keep iterating on the press release until they've come up with benefits that actually sound like benefits. Iterating on a press release is a lot less expensive than iterating on the product itself (and quicker!).

If the press release is more than a page and a half, it is probably too long. Keep it simple. 3-4 sentences for most paragraphs. Cut out the fat. Don't make it into a spec. You can accompany the press release with a FAQ that answers all of the other business or execution questions so the press release can stay focused on what the customer gets. My rule of thumb is that if the press release is hard to write, then the product is probably going to suck. Keep working at it until the outline for each paragraph flows. 

Oh, and I also like to write press-releases in what I call "Oprah-speak" for mainstream consumer products. Imagine you're sitting on Oprah's couch and have just explained the product to her, and then you listen as she explains it to her audience. That's "Oprah-speak", not "Geek-speak".

Once the project moves into development, the press release can be used as a touchstone; a guiding light. The product team can ask themselves, "Are we building what is in the press release?" If they find they're spending time building things that aren't in the press release (overbuilding), they need to ask themselves why. This keeps product development focused on achieving the customer benefits and not building extraneous stuff that takes longer to build, takes resources to maintain, and doesn't provide real customer benefit (at least not enough to warrant inclusion in the press release).

 ## Retain what you learn
__Description:__ An app to generate questions and answers to help people retain information more effectively. When you read something on the web or learn something new, you can create a question and answer out of it and then save it. Review your questions at any time. Tag questions. Similar to flash cards, but uses spaced repetition and buffers to help you learn more effectively.

__Functionality__:
- Input form to add a new question and the answer user would like to remember
- Tags: lets you tag a question (e.g. JavaScript, Music, People Names, etc.)
- Submit button pushes user's question to database
- User profile page that shows all their questions
  - Button to delete questions
  - Button to edit questions
- Quiz me!
    - __Optional:__ Pick a category to be quizzed on (default is all questions)
    - Randomly picks questions from user's question list and generates quiz
    - If you get it right, pop off the question from list so you donâ€™t get asked again in the current session
    - Iterate until user has gone through all the question OR user decides to exit the quiz
 
## Heading ##
  * Knowit All

## Sub-Heading ##
  * For any leaner who wants to learn more effectively by retaining what they learn. 

## Summary ##
  * An app to generate questions and answers. When you read something on the web or learn something new, you can create a question and answer out of it, tag it into an appropriate category and then save it. Review your questions at any time. Similar to flash cards, but uses spaced repetition techniques and auto-generated quizzes to help ease the learning process without putting too much burden on the user to remember to "learn".

## Problem ##
  * We learn so much new and useful information everyday but unfortunately retain a negligible percentage of that information. 

## Solution ##
  * Knowit All solves this problem by creating a place where users can store all their knowledge. Anytime a user wants to remember something, they enter it as a question and Knowit All will guarantee that the user will be remember this forever. 

## Quote from You ##
  * "Knowit All is the future of learning and education. Every classroom, student and learner in the world should be using KnowIt All if they want to become smart."

## How to Get Started ##
  * Create a question, create the answer, tag it and enjoy!

## Customer Quote ##
  * "Knowit All seriously changes the game when it comes to learning anything. All I have to do is tell KnowIt All that I want to rememeber something. Then it does the job of teaching it to me in a fun and effective way."

## Closing and Call to Action ##
 * Beta release of the product will be November 10, 2015. Don't miss out!
