> KnowIt All is an app to generate questions and answers to help people retain information more effectively. When you read something on the web or learn something new, you can create a question and answer out of it and then save it. Review your questions at any time. Tag questions. Similar to flash cards today, but in the future, I plan to add functionality to use spaced repetition and buffers to help you learn more effectively.

> **Problem:** We learn so much new and useful information everyday but unfortunately retain a negligible percentage of that information. 

> **Solution:** I believe Knowit All has the potential to solve this problem by creating a place where users can store all their knowledge. Anytime a user wants to remember something, they enter it as a question and Knowit All will guarantee that the user will be remember this forever.

## Usage

> To begin using KnowIt All, open the application. Then create a question, create the answer, tag it and save it! 

> Quiz yourself on your questions anytime you have a spare minute. Keep quizzing yourself on every question until it's engrained in your memory, then delete the question once you feel like you know it. 

> That's it!

## Requirements

- Node
- Bower

## Development

### Installing Dependencies
- Download project directory
- Save directory to your local file system
- Open your terminal and **cd** into the directory

From within the root directory:

```sh

Run 'npm install'
After this, you should see a node modules folder created in root directory
Run 'npm install -g bower'
Run 'bower install'
You should see the lib folder populated with various bower components
Install nodemon if it's not already installed 'npm install -g nodemon'
Make sure you have MongoDB installed. 
Then open a new tab in your terminal and run 'mongod'
Run 'npm start'
Go to http://localhost:4568 to open the application

```
